# FireFighterWebSite
Visualizing temperatures sensor that was placed in the firefighter container via a web-based monitoring application.

The real-life problem that was given by the customer is reading and visualizing temperatures through sensors in current
time measurements as well as past measurements. In addition to these features this a web-based application had to be 
user friendly and easy to comprehend, so introduce the web-based app with some additional features such that, each user 
can access their account privately by scanning the QR code of the website, user can visualize each sensors temperatures 
individually via line charts and heatmap, by logging in as an admin the user has some privileges, for instance, the admin
add or remove the sensor. While developing this site I focused on how a user can visualize, manipulate the data better and 
faster during the fire training session.
